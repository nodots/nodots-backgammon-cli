# Player Identification Bug Fix

## Summary
Fixed a critical bug in the human-vs-robot game functionality where both players were being displayed as robots instead of correctly identifying one as human and one as robot.

## Problem
- The CLI commands `human-vs-robot` and `game-status` were using hard-coded array index assumptions to identify players
- `index === 0` was assumed to be human, `index === 1` was assumed to be robot
- This was incorrect because the backend API may return players in any order
- Result: Both players were shown as robots in the CLI output

## Root Cause
The player identification logic in both commands was using:
```typescript
// BROKEN: Hard-coded index assumption
const isHuman = index === 0
```

Instead of the correct logic:
```typescript
// CORRECT: Match player ID with current user ID
const isHuman = player.id === apiConfig.userId
```

## Files Fixed
- `src/commands/human-vs-robot.ts`: Fixed player identification logic
- `src/commands/game-status.ts`: Fixed player identification logic

## Testing
- Created a test script that demonstrated the bug and verified the fix
- All existing unit tests pass (29/29)
- Verified the fix works with mock data showing different player orders

## Expected Behavior Now
- Human players are correctly identified by matching `player.id === currentUserId`
- Robot players are correctly identified as any player whose ID doesn't match the current user
- Display shows proper ðŸ‘¤ Human / ðŸ¤– Robot icons regardless of player order in the API response

## Technical Details
The fix changes from index-based assumptions to ID-based matching, making the CLI robust to any player ordering returned by the backend API. This ensures the human player is always correctly identified regardless of whether they appear first or second in the players array.
